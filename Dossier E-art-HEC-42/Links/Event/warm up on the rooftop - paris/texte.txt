Warm Up goes on holiday!

On the 13th May Warm Up will be taking over the beautiful Nuba rooftop in Paris for a 10hr open air summer rave up! The magic begins at 18.00 on the 13th May and runs through till 04.00.

The scene 

It’s 18.00, the warm sun is still shining, the cocktails are flowing, the early evening summer atmosphere is now starting to bubble. There’s an exciting buzz flowing through the airwaves on the rooftop. We begin our adventure; deep warm melodies and slow groovy baslines start to softly pulsate through the speakers. The vibes start to build....

Its now 22.00, the sun is now setting, the party atmosphere is building nicely and the grooves are now rolling with a bit more pace. Things are starting to heat up!

Midnight........................... the madness is now full swing, the vibe is electric, we are now going full throtle, those positive emotions are starting to take a hold and the love is flowing.

See you on the rooftop Paris!
